libobj

Libobj provides a parser for the Wavefront OBJ file format.

It is not complete, i.e.  groups and parametric curves for example
are not supported (ignored during parsing), plus it is required for the
user to manipulate the loaded structures manually, because of the
basically non-existent API.
